# nba_analysis
This is NBA analysis using data from Kaggle. It reflects prelim analysis. Use of ML or Linear Regression, it can be used and refined further to perhaps see which team has more chances of winning given no trades.

🚨 N.B.A Live (using Python 🐍 :p) 🚨

Over the past few days, I dived into NBA data and built a simple exploratory analysis project in Python. Using pandas, NumPy, and matplotlib, I explored:

🏀 How many games were played (71,829 between 1946–2025)
📍 Which cities hosted the most matches (L.A., Boston, New York, Philly, Detroit)
👑 LeBron’s performance trends (career FG% growth, peak years in 2013 & 2017, consistent 50%+ efficiency in recent years)
📊 Scoring breakdowns (more than 50% of his points are 2-pointers — classic small forward stats!)
🏆 Team dominance (identifying the most winning teams by year, especially between 2015–2025)

The analysis was simple EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis), but it highlighted how much insight you can uncover with just Python basics.

👉 The exciting part?
This is just scratching the surface. With deeper Machine Learning and Regression Modeling, we could move beyond historical analysis to predicting future winners, player performance, or even which teams might be safer bets in a season.

💡 I’d love to hear from this amazing community:
➡️ What are the best courses (Udemy, Coursera, etc.) to learn ML/Regression Modeling specifically for sports analytics or time-series prediction?
